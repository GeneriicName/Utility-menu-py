# Utility-menu-py
A utility menu i made while working as an help desk, was made in between calls, so needs lots of rework

***you will need to configure the config file before starting it up***, i added some comments as for how to configure it and with some examples.
the features are as for the following
**Clean space from remote computers**, you can configure which directories to clean up via the config file
***Get network printers from the computer***
